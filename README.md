# dig-demo

## request
At this [url](http://private-5815fe-recommendationsknip.apiary-mock.com/products) you can find JSON response with the list of products.
  
You should create small react-native application which will have only two screens.
First screen will display list of the products with title, one image (thumbnail) and price.
Second screen should display title, description, specification, price and product images.
Product Images should be displayed as a small gallery, you should use "original" property to display large/selected image.
  
As a bonus you can add possibility of adding comments for each of the products. They shouldn't be sent to server, it will be enough to save them in react-native AsyncStorage and display them at single product page.

## Requirements
 
Only requirement is to use React-Native with Redux http://redux.js.org/ to finish the task. Other tools you can choose on your own.
 
Please track time required for you to finish the task (approximately).

Also, it would be ideal if you create repo on github and submit your code there.

The time limit for this is one week.

## My results
Total time was around 5 hours of coding.  Core tasks (app layout, page navigation, digesting/displaying/styling) took around 2.5 hours total.  Rest of the time was spent building the comment system, tons of UI revisions to make the app as usable as possible (despite being a demo), and building splash screens for app startup.
